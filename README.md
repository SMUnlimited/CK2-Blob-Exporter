## Crusader Kings 2 Blob Exporter Mod

(Requires the EU4 converter) 
This simple mod makes it so you require high or absolute crown authority 
to prevent your realm splitting into vassals when exporting to EU4. (No change to HRE) 

It also increases the number of total created vassals from 4 to 7. 
You have to decide if you keep them all and take the diplomacy hit or discard some 

This mod was created due to the frustration of large empires (blob realms) easily 
exported into EU4 taking over the world. Medium crown authority is supposed 
to represent both the crown and vassals having balanced power so this 
represents they still have equal say once the medieval age is ending. 

Works with ck2 version 2.4.5 and EU4 1.13
